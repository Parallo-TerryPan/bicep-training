# Introduction 

Workshop sessions are intended to give engineers a basic understanding behind key concepts and tools used by DevOps engineers in their day-to-day work.  

# Time and Effort Expectations
The workshop sessions have been designed to enable a participant to follow along and complete the sessions without outside help. If help is required, the participant can reach out to a mentor, who will be appointed when a participant starts the workshops. Like anything, the participant can always reach out to the wider team for help if required.
